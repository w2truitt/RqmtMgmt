## üèóÔ∏è Test Organization Architecture

### **Proposed Test Execution Model**

#### **TestPlan** (Top-Level Document)
- Contains the complete list of test cases to be executed
- Serves as the template for test run sessions
- Used for comprehensive reporting (latest results of all TestCases in the plan)

#### **TestSuite** (Grouping Mechanism)
- Groups related test cases (e.g., integration tests in same assembly)
- Can be used as a selection filter when creating test run sessions
- Allows for targeted execution of specific test groups

#### **TestRunSession** (Execution Instance)
- Created from a TestPlan with selected TestCases
- Supports both TestSuite-based grouping and individual test selection
- Tracks execution progress and results for a specific run

#### **Execution Workflows**
1. **Full Test Plan Execution**: Execute all test cases in a test plan
2. **TestSuite-Based Execution**: Execute all test cases in specific test suites
3. **Custom Selection Execution**: Execute manually selected test cases
4. **Single Test Execution**: Execute individual test cases for debugging

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Design

### **TestRunSessions Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE TestRunSessions (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    Name NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Description NVARCHAR(MAX),
    TestPlanId INT NOT NULL,
    ExecutedBy INT NOT NULL,
    StartedAt DATETIME2 NOT NULL,
    CompletedAt DATETIME2,
    Status NVARCHAR(450) NOT NULL, -- TestRunStatus enum
    Environment NVARCHAR(100),
    BuildVersion NVARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (TestPlanId) REFERENCES TestPlans(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (ExecutedBy) REFERENCES Users(Id)
);
```

### **TestCaseExecutions Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE TestCaseExecutions (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    TestRunSessionId INT NOT NULL,
    TestCaseId INT NOT NULL,
    OverallResult NVARCHAR(450) NOT NULL, -- TestResult enum
    ExecutedAt DATETIME2,
    ExecutedBy INT,
    Notes NVARCHAR(MAX),
    DefectId NVARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (TestRunSessionId) REFERENCES TestRunSessions(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (TestCaseId) REFERENCES TestCases(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (ExecutedBy) REFERENCES Users(Id)

    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    TestCaseExecutionId INT NOT NULL,
    TestStepId INT NOT NULL,
    StepOrder INT NOT NULL,
    Result NVARCHAR(450) NOT NULL, -- TestResult enum
    ActualResult NVARCHAR(MAX),

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### **Dashboard Query Optimizations**
- [x] Requirements count by status (single GROUP BY query)
- [x] Test execution statistics (aggregated queries)
- [x] Test coverage calculations (JOIN with counts)
- [x] Recent activities (TOP N with ORDER BY)

### **Example Optimized Queries**
```sql
-- Requirements statistics in one query
SELECT Status, COUNT(*) as Count 
FROM Requirements 
GROUP BY Status;

-- Test execution summary
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as TotalExecutions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN OverallResult = 'Passed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as PassedCount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN OverallResult = 'Failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as FailedCount
FROM TestCaseExecutions 
WHERE TestRunSessionId IN (SELECT Id FROM TestRunSessions WHERE Status = 'Completed');
```

## üìù Notes

- **Performance First**: All dashboard queries use COUNT() and aggregations, not loading full datasets
- **Granular Tracking**: Each test step execution is tracked individually  
- **Historical Data**: Design supports tracking test execution trends over time
- **Scalable Architecture**: Services designed to handle multiple concurrent test runs
- **Test Coverage**: Track which test cases have been executed vs total test cases
- **Threading Fixed**: Sequential query execution prevents DbContext threading issues
- **Multi-User Support**: Architecture supports multiple users executing tests simultaneously
- **Flexible Test Organization**: Supports TestSuite grouping, TestPlan execution, and custom selections

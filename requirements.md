# Requirements Management and Test Management Tool Requirements

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a web-based tool designed to manage requirements and testing for software and product development projects. The tool will support management of Customer Requirement Specifications (CRS), Product Requirement Specifications (PRS), Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), and provide features for Quality Assurance to manage test suites, test cases, and track test executions.

## 2. Stakeholders
- Product Owners
- Business Analysts
- System Engineers
- Software Developers
- Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers
- Project Managers

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Requirement Management
- The tool shall allow creation, editing, and deletion of Customer Requirement Specifications (CRS).
- The tool shall allow creation, editing, and deletion of Product Requirement Specifications (PRS).
- The tool shall allow creation, editing, and deletion of Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).
- The tool shall support hierarchical relationships between CRS, PRS, and SRS (e.g., CRS can be decomposed into PRS, which can be decomposed into SRS).
- The tool shall provide version control for all requirement types.
- The tool shall allow linking of requirements to related items (e.g., CRS to PRS, PRS to SRS, requirements to test cases).
- The tool shall support requirement status tracking (e.g., Draft, Approved, Implemented, Verified).
- The tool shall allow users to add comments and attachments to requirements.
- The tool shall provide search and filter capabilities for all requirement types.

### 3.2 Test Management
- The tool shall allow creation, editing, and deletion of Test Suites.
- The tool shall allow creation, editing, and deletion of Test Cases within Test Suites.
- The tool shall allow linking Test Cases to specific requirements (CRS, PRS, SRS).
- The tool shall allow execution of Test Runs for Test Suites and individual Test Cases.
- The tool shall record the result of each Test Run (e.g., Passed, Failed, Blocked, Not Run).
- The tool shall allow users to record notes and attach evidence (e.g., screenshots, logs) to Test Runs.
- The tool shall provide a history of Test Runs for each Test Case.
- The tool shall provide reporting and dashboard features for test execution status, coverage, and defect tracking.

### 3.3 User Management & Security
- The tool shall support user authentication and authorization.
- The tool shall support role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Product Owner, QA, Developer, Viewer).
- The tool shall log user actions for audit purposes.

### 3.4 General Features
- The tool shall be accessible via a web browser.
- The tool shall provide a responsive user interface suitable for desktop and tablet devices.
- The tool shall provide API access for integration with other tools (e.g., issue trackers, CI/CD systems).
- The tool shall support exporting requirements and test results to standard formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- The tool shall be available 99.5% of the time (excluding scheduled maintenance).
- The tool shall ensure data integrity and backup.
- The tool shall comply with relevant data privacy and security standards.
- The tool shall support concurrent users without performance degradation.

## 5. Quality Assurance
- The tool shall provide test coverage reports to ensure all requirements are validated by test cases.
- The tool shall support traceability from requirements to test cases and test results.

## 6. Glossary
- **CRS**: Customer Requirement Specification
- **PRS**: Product Requirement Specification
- **SRS**: Software Requirement Specification
- **Test Suite**: A collection of test cases grouped for execution
- **Test Case**: A specific scenario to validate a requirement or feature
- **Test Run**: Execution instance of a test case or suite
